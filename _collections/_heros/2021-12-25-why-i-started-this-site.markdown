it all started with a book i come across called freedom the end of the human conditition i dont even read books last book i read was the beano sat on my grans toilet ....

through out my life its been a struggle many obstacles  thrown my way but ive always been a person to see these obstacles as a challenges 

starting from my very 1st memory of being a child from a broken family with my dad being an alcoholic it was hard living with my mother and elder siblings all i can remember is my father being drunk at the door when he was suppose to take us out for the day to him hiding in the attic for months to him actually causing a fire an collapsing the ceiling into my bedroom we knew how long with the amount of empty cans ???!!! Alcohol What a lovely thing that is !!!! god rest his soul he couldn't find the help what was needed for him and passed when i was of around 14-15 years old 

.all i can remember going through school (schools)( i went to around 9 schools in total due to the fact they could not handle me i was takin to a few doctors back in the day (adhd) was not about back then so i went through quite a lot of the education system i loved learning but not noncense which i told them.

 ive still be learning everyday of my life which is great 

the propaganda that has been writtin regarding humanity and history needs to change for the better 

that a person was sat in front a class room telling kids in about manner apart from the odd few

was about our great kings n queens and the lord jesus and and to be good to one another  whiles in the same breath telling us about all the Not so great wars and battles our ancestors have been through to get us to the stage where we at now  dont get me wrong i think English maths and a few other subjects are standard procured of what a human needs to learn 

Where was the agruculral asrtomany spirtal awareness 

where was the learning to pay bills of what to come in Real life instead of training us to go straight into a work factory 9-5 sometimes more 6days a week WHAT !!!! apart from the odd antunampers that come up with great ideas an go work of there own back Brilliant but apart from the odd few the education system has been put in place so that the main human population will work in a  system that make the rich richer and not the the grace of humanity Greed! a powerful word 

 

when i was around 12 years old i had my baby nephew die on me while we was sleeping he was 4 months old god rest his soul x i did initially think that i had killed him as there was marks on his face like crinkles off my top 

i tried doing some mouth to mouth and 4 fingers on his chest as id only just seen that on tv couple nights before but unfurtantly he had passed i heard my sister screaming BENS killed my baby i ran out the house as fast as i could in the underwear i ran to the phonebox on the main road to ring for an ambulance as i arrived back at the house my sister was coming down the stairs as i approached the look on her face i just ran and ran i ended up down an alley wit a shard of glass at the stomach asking for forgiveness and that am sorry i blanked out n remember just in a car on the way to hospital when we arrived all my family was there came running over to me with open arms it was esotericall just remember saying have i killed him?/is it my fault n everyone crying the doctors came out with that if he had suffocated it would of shown it was not my fault it was class as cot death ... rip dominic x ive never really got over it was the doctors just saying that went through my head millions of times thats one of the challenges off life that ive had to go through 

at an early age of my life family member started dying My cousin hung himself My gran passed away then my father passed this happend it seemed all at ones one after another ina space of 2 years 

 i was at an age of 15 when my dad died this was a toning point in my life when i realised that the way iwas going was leading to a path of jail or the cemetery so i was offered a place at college for my last year of schooling as the tutors i had been given to me after no school in Lancashire would except me in and we tried so i had private tutors for a few months then got offered the place at college haliiliua a place where you get spoken to like a human being a PROPPER real life conversations on how you looked at things instead of no its writtin like this so it must be true?!!!!

i finished the college with flying colours by this time ive already started looking for work an what i found as i live in a tourist town theres quite a few ways of earning a living by the seaside dontforget a was still only 15-16 still going park with my mates some nights as they sated with the pubs n that at weekends i was always earning a few quide on the seeside selling sunglasses when it was sunny and umbrellas when it rained we was right out side the world famous pleasure beach literally right outside which they hated and so did the council but far as am concerned i was doing no harm selling my wares with a licence which ive had since i was 17years old  the legal age required to receive a peddlers certificate  which is issued my her majesty's police force and for a person to receive such a certificate they need to be in good character within the system 

so the police do all the checks with the local authorisations   an soso 

 

peddlers licence 1 yearly subscription renewed 

 

since 1998 to 2018  i had my peddlers

then in 2018 i went to renew my licence but the police officer told me that there sergeant has the licence removed from me due to a driving ban ? A DRIVING BAN which i received no points no fine? for having cannabis in my system don't get me wrong i would never drive impaired i do not agree with drink driving ANYWAY

but as i now have a criminal record so the police chief sergeant says before doing any checks with any other authority i cannot receive my peddlers therefore i can not do a trade which i have done since leaving school

 

whala #

finally they stopped me from trading on blackpool sea front 

did i tell you about under the old law of peddling you need to keep on the move or use a horse and cart so nowadays people use a trolly n for that reason i must of had 30-50 confiscation of my full trolley with stock and  fines that the council has given me in these year am takin

before they accepted that they was wrong and that we could use a peddlers they learnt the law thats been in place for YEARS anyway due to all the fines they gave me i gladly paid them i seen it as i contribution for working on the streets and not paying the astronautical  council rates and taxes i weren't paying so i looked it as i weekly payment towards that this made them angry so instead of fining me this one time they took my driving licence away from me funny thing is i didnt drive i had not passed my test ? idid have a provisional  many years late i did my lessons around the age of 34

 

so one of the hicups that stick out to me when i was abut 24 they came up with a plan of action 

 

 

Blackpool Trading Standards and Blackpool Pleasure Beach Security hatched a plot of nonsense with not one bit of evidence not one member of public report NOT one police report came up with a load of allegations and took me to high court with all the wigs n that anyway some how they put me on a antisocial behaviour order banning me from the whole of Blackpool promenade which is miles banning me or face prison if i entered the area  

a big chunk of the town was also highlighted which i could not enter which was literally across near where i lived so faced prision for going to the local shops which i could not even access in a taxi never mind walkin his is what the judge pointed out to me that was because it was within a mile of the funfair  and the main reason for the asbo was the saftey of blackpool plesure beach staff and blackpool council staff ???  i was on the asbo order which was in pace for 3 years so i went back to college n for computer technology as doing this i was also trying new things too many to be honest  which was a cause of my fianc√© leaving me when i ws 29 thats another chapter  

shockin i know i will get a few pics up to explain the nonsense what i had to put up with 

i leave it there for now ive got so much to say what ive personally exercised then it leads to this where ifelt like i was being haunted and basically telling me to commit suicide for the the rest of humanity due to the way ive lived my life it can leave humanity with all the good ive learnt and the bad can basically go with me 

 these videos below is my very first time ive spoken live or done any video like this and i was having a rant not realised that i admitted to the whole would bout my suicidal thoughts so i did one to explain my rant .
